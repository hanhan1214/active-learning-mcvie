3743,Commission Regulation (EC) No 637/2002 of 12 April 2002 redistributing unused portions of the 2001 quantitative quotas for certain products originating in the People's Republic of China THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 520/94 of 7 March 1994 establishing a Community procedure for administering quantitative quotas(1)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 138/96(2)  and in particular Article 2(5) and Articles 14 and 24 thereof  Whereas: (1) Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports from certain third countries and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1765/82  (EEC) No 1766/82 and (EEC) No 3420/83(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1138/98(4)  introduced annual quantitative quotas for certain products originating in the People's Republic of China listed in Annex II to that Regulation. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 are applicable to those quotas. (2) The Commission accordingly adopted Regulation (EC) No 738/94(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 983/96(6)  laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94. These provisions apply to the administration of the above quotas subject to the provisions of this Regulation. (3) In accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94  the competent authorities of the Member States notified the Commission of the quantities of quotas assigned in 2001 and not used. (4) The unused quantities could not be redistributed in time to be used before the end of the 2001 quota year. (5) Examination of the data received for each of the products in question indicates that the quantities not used in the 2001 quota year should be redistributed in 2002  up to a limit of the amounts set out in Annex I to this Regulation. (6) The different administrative methods provided for by Regulation (EC) No 520/94 have been analysed and it is considered that the method based on traditional trade flows should be adopted. Under this method quota tranches are divided into two portions  one of which is reserved for traditional importers and the other for other applicants. (7) This has proved to be the best way of ensuring the continuity of business for the Community importers concerned and avoiding any disturbance of trade flows. (8) Quantities redistributed under this Regulation should be divided using the same criteria as for the allocation of the 2001 quotas except as regard the determination of the reference period for traditional importers and the introduction of new criteria to prevent multiple applications by non-traditional importers. (9) The reference period used for redistributing the portion of the unused quantities set aside for traditional importers in the previous Regulation on the administration of these quotas should not be updated. The year 2000 was characterised by certain distortions  in particular a more than twofold increase of applications from one Member State  which resulted in substantially reduced individual quota allocations to all non-traditional importers in all Member States. The years 1998 or 1999 are  thus  the most recent years representatives of the normal trend of trade flows in the products in question. Traditional importers must  therefore  prove that they have imported products originating in China and covered by the quotas in question in the years 1998 or 1999. (10) It has been found that the unusual increase of applications lodged for the portion of the quota set aside for non-traditional importers is due to multiple licence applications from companies who do not effectively operate as separate importers  but which have been established as separate legal entities only for the purpose of being able to submit additional applications. Regulation (EC) No 520/94  in particular recital 5 and Article 5 thereof  requires the Commission to ensure fair access to quotas and that import licences be issued for economically significant quantities. To redistribute the non-traditional quota in line with these principles  the administrative procedures should be amended. The Commission considers it necessary that operators applying as non-traditional importers and falling under the definition of related persons within the meaning of Article 143 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(7)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2002(8)  may only submit a single licence application for each line of the quota set aside for non-traditional importers. In order to exclude speculative applications  the amount that any non-traditional importer may request should be restricted to a set volume. (11) It is necessary to simplify the formalities to be fulfilled by traditional importers who already hold import licences issued when the 2002 Community quotas were allocated. The competent administrative authorities already possess the requisite evidence of either 1998 or 1999 imports for all traditional importers. The latter need therefore only enclose a copy of their previous licences with their new licence applications. (12) Measures should be taken to provide the best conditions for the allocation of that portion of the quota reserved for non-traditional importers with a view to optimum use of quotas. To this end  it is appropriate to provide for that portion to be allocated in proportion to the quantities requested  on the basis of a simultaneous examination of import licence applications actually lodged  and grant access only to importers who can prove that they obtained and made use of at least 80 % of an import licence for the product in question during the 2001 quota year. The amount that any non-traditional importer may request should also be restricted to a set volume or value. (13) For the purposes of quota allocation  a time limit must be set for the submission of licence applications by traditional and other importers. (14) With a view to optimum use of quotas  licence applications for imports of footwear under quotas which refer to several CN codes must specify the quantities required for each code. (15) The Member States must inform the Commission of the import licence applications received  in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94. The information about traditional importers' previous imports must be expressed in the same units as the quota in question. (16) In the light of the experience gained in the management of the quotas  in order to facilitate import administration formalities to economic operators and in view of the fact that unused quantities may not be carried over to the following year more than once  thus limiting the risk of excessive accumulation of imports  it is deemed appropriate  without prejudice to the results of a further analysis which may appear to be warranted in this respect in the future  to set the expiry date of the redistribution import licences as 31 December 2002.

In view of the difficulties that this causes for importers holding licences issued during the first six months of 2002  the validity period was extended by three months to 30 September 2002 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1333/2002(7) derogating from Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001(8)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1667/2002(9). Given that these difficulties persist and  furthermore  that the veterinary checks carried out by the Lithuanian authorities led to the temporary suspension of certain operators from the possibility to export dairy products  the validity of the import licences should exceptionally be extended further up to 31 January 2003.

(2) Pursuant to Article 17(3)(a) of Directive 92/65/EEC Community on-the-spot visits have to be carried out to ensure the uniform application of the abovementioned Directive  and in particular its Annexes. (3) Therefore it is justified to draw up a provisional list of centres approved for the collection of semen of equidae for imports into the European Community  for which the competent authorities of the third country concerned provided guarantees equivalent to those of Chapter II of Directive 92/65/EEC.

(2) Given the need to further examine certain aspects of the investigation and also because of the interrelation with the abovementioned interim review  it was decided to continue the investigation without the imposition of provisional measures. (3) The Commission therefore subsequently continued the investigation of dumping  injury and Community interest  and the definitive findings and conclusions of this investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 (3) imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia (the definitive Regulation).
