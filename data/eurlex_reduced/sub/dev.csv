0,REGULATION (EEC) No 2481/75 OF THE COUNCIL  of 29 September 1975  amending Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 laying down special measures for improving the production and marketing of Community citrus fruits THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  and in particular Article 43 thereof; Having regard to the proposal from the Commission; Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1); Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 (2) of 9 December 1969 laying down special measures for improving the production and marketing of Community citrus fruits  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 175/73 (3)  provides for the granting of additional aid to small farmers to compensate for part of the loss of income caused by replanting; Whereas one of the conditions for the granting of this aid is that the area of the undertaking does not exceed five hectares ; whereas  when the total area of the undertaking exceeds five hectares but the area fit for agricultural use does not exceed that limit since the rest of the land is not cultivable  the farmer's economic situation is the same as in the cases mentioned in the Regulation ; whereas all farmers of an area fit for agricultural use not exceeding five hectares should receive identical treatment; Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 set up in particular a scheme of financial compensation to promote sales of Community-produced oranges and mandarins on Community import markets by means of contracts ensuring regular supplies for these markets; Whereas experience has shown that the contractual scheme referred to above has not had the desired results as regards the growth of Community outlets for the products in question ; whereas  moreover  the increase in competition from certain producer third countries can only make it more difficult to market Community-produced citrus fruit on the Community market; Whereas to counter these difficulties Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 should be modified by discontinuing the contractual scheme and increasing the amounts of financial compensation ; whereas this compensation should be extended to include clementines; Whereas during the recent marketing years there have also been problems as regards the distribution of Community lemon production on the Community import markets ; whereas  therefore  it is advisable  as a precautionary measure  to grant financial compensation in respect of this product for the remainder of the 1975/76 marketing year; Whereas  in order to ensure the effectiveness of such a system  provision should be made for bringing up to date the amounts fixed in respect of oranges  mandarins and clementines  taking into account the trend of the basic and buying-in prices for the products concerned ,0,0,0,0,1,0

(2) On 22 October 2001  Denmark transferred to Sweden 50 tonnes of whiting in the waters of Skagerrak and Kattegat. Fishing for whiting in the waters of Skagerrak and Kattegat by vessels flying the flag of Sweden or registered in Sweden should consequently be authorised. Regulation (EC) No 743/2001 should therefore be repealed ,0,0,0,0,0,0

3,23.12.2005 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 340/39 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2129/2005 of 22 December 2005 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1)  and in particular Article 13(3) thereof  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2)  and in particular Article 14(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without  however  preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met. (5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States  approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4)  it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination. (6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed  taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable  pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5)  for the basic product in question  used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods. (7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However  Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom  Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly  it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages. (8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman ,0,1,0,0,0,0

5,Commission Decision of 28 December 1979 authorizing the Federal Republic of Germany to restrict the marketing of seed of certain varieties of agricultural plant species (Only the German text is authentic) (80/126/EEC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community  Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species [1]  as last amended by Council Directive 79/967/EEC of 12 November 1979 [2]  and in particular Article 15 (2)  (3) and (7) thereof  Having regard to the application lodged by the Federal Republic of Germany  Whereas under Article 15 (1) of the said Directive  seed or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted during 1977 in one or more Member States and which also meet the conditions laid down in the said Directive are  with effect from 31 December 1979  no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety in the Community; Whereas  however  Article 15 (2) thereof provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties; Whereas the Federal Republic of Germany has applied for such authorization for a certain number of varieties of different species; Whereas the variety Kaweintermono (sugar beet) and the concerned varieties of oats and of maize have not been the subject of official growing trials in the Federal Republic of Germany in view of the German application; Whereas the said variety of sugar beet has been the subject in the Federal Republic of Germany of an application for official acceptance in so far as their seed is to be marketed in another country (Article 4 (2) (b) thereof); whereas therefore even the applicant has not claimed that this variety has any satisfactory value for cultivation or use in the Federal Republic of Germany; whereas therefore this variety can be treated as not producing results in the Federal Republic of Germany  which  with respect to their qualities taken as a whole as regards their value for cultivation or use  correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (first subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) thereof); Whereas the variety of oats concerned is of the winter type; whereas the varieties of maize concerned have an FAO maturity class index over 350; whereas it is well known that the varieties of winter oats and the varieties of maize which have an FAO maturity class over 350 are at present not yet suitable for cultivation in view of all the kinds of utilization in the Federal Republic of Germany (second subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) of the said Directive); Whereas the other varieties listed in this Decision have been the subject of official growing trials in the Federal Republic of Germany; whereas the results of these trials have led the Federal Republic of Germany to decide that these varieties are not distinct or that their value for cultivation or use does not correspond to other varieties accepted in the Federal Republic of Germany; Whereas  in respect of the varieties Bergond (Red fescue) and Goal (Perennial rye grass)  the results of the trials show that in the Federal Republic of Germany  when compared with the national rules governing the acceptance of varieties there  which apply within the framework of current Community provisions  they are not distinct from other varieties accepted there (Article 15 (3) (a) thereof); Whereas therefore the application of the Federal Republic of Germany in respect of all these varieties should be granted in full; whereas some of the concerned varieties of maize are acceptable in the Federal Republic of Germany in so far as their seeds are intended for fodder production (green fodder); Whereas  in respect of the other cases the application of the Federal Republic of Germany is under examination by the Commission; whereas it is not possible to complete examination of the abovementioned variety before expiry of the period provided for in Article 15 (1) of the said Directive; Whereas it consequently seems desirable to extend for the Federal Republic of Germany the period in question for an appropriate time to permit a full examination of the request for those varieties (Article 15 (7) of the said Directive); Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seed and Propagating Material for Agriculture  Horticulture and Forestry ,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,Commission Regulation (EC) No 685/2002 of 19 April 2002 amending the import duties in the cereals sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2)  Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 of 28 June 1996 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 597/2002(4)  and in particular Article 2(1) thereof  Whereas: (1) The import duties in the cereals sector are fixed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 649/2002(5)  as amended by Regulation (EC) No 657/2002(6). (2) Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 provides that if during the period of application  the average import duty calculated differs by EUR 5 per tonne from the duty fixed  a corresponding adjustment is to be made. Such a difference has arisen. It is therefore necessary to adjust the import duties fixed in Regulation (EC) No 649/2002 ,1,0,1,0,0,0
7,Commission Regulation (EC) No 2020/2003 of 14 November 2003 fixing the import duties in the cereals sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1104/2003(2)  Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 of 28 June 1996 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1110/2003(4)  and in particular Article 2(1) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff are to be charged on import of the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. However  in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article  the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %  minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However  that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff. (2) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92  the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market. (3) Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector. (4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force. They also remain in force in cases where no quotation is available for the reference exchange referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 during the two weeks preceding the next periodical fixing. (5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally  the representative market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties. (6) Application of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 results in import duties being fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation ,1,0,0,0,0,0
8,2.3.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 64/20 COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 223/2007 of 1 March 2007 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1)  and in particular Article 31(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a)  (b)  (c)  (d)  (e)  and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. (2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2)  specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed  to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. (3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005  the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month. (4) However  in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty  there is a danger that  if high refund rates are fixed in advance  the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures  but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met. (5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that  when the rate of the refund is being fixed  account is to be taken  where appropriate  of production refunds  aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

(2) However  the information presently available on the conditions applying in third countries is still not sufficient to enable the Commission to adopt any such decision in respect of any third country at this stage. (3) In order to prevent trade patterns from being disrupted  Member States importing vegetable propagating and planting material  other than seed  from third countries should be allowed to continue to apply to such products conditions equivalent to those applicable to similar Community products in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 92/33/EEC. (4) The period of application of the derogation provided for in Article 16(2) the first subparagraph of Directive 92/33/EEC  which was extended until 31 December 2004 by Commission Decision 2002/111/EC (2) should accordingly be further extended.

11,31.8.2012 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 234/4 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 784/2012 of 30 August 2012 amending Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 to list an auction platform to be appointed by Germany and correcting Article 59(7) thereof (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1)  and in particular Articles 3d(3) and 10(4) thereof  Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 of 12 November 2010 on the timing  administration and other aspects of auctioning of greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the Community (2)  allows Member States not participating in the joint action as provided in Article 26(1) and (2) to appoint their own auction platform for the auctioning of their share of the volume of allowances covered by Chapters II and III of Directive 2003/87/EC. The appointment of such auction platforms is subject to listing of the auction platform concerned in Annex III  pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 30(5) of that Regulation. (2) In accordance with Article 30(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010  Germany informed the Commission of its decision not to participate in the joint action as provided in Article 26(1) and (2) of that Regulation  and to appoint its own auction platform. (3) On 9 March 2012  Germany notified the Commission of its intention to appoint European Energy Exchange AG (‘EEX’) as an auction platform referred to in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010. (4) On 22 March 2012  Germany presented the notification to the Climate Change Committee. In addition  Germany has provided further information and clarification to the Commission  supplementing the notification accordingly. (5) The proposed appointment of EEX as an auction platform referred to in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 is compatible with the requirements of that Regulation and is in conformity with the objectives set out in Article 10(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC. (6) In accordance with point (e) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010  an auction platform must not abuse the contract appointing it to unduly leverage the competitiveness of its other activities  notably the secondary market it organises. Therefore  the listing of EEX as an auction platform should be conditional upon EEX providing the option to candidate bidders to be admitted to bid in the auctions without being required to become a member of or a participant in the secondary market organised by EEX or of any other trading place operated by EEX or by any third party. (7) In accordance with point (h) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010  when appointing an auction platform  the Member States have to take into account the extent to which adequate measures are provided to require an auction platform to hand over all tangible and intangible assets necessary for the conduct of the auctions by an auction platform’s successor. Such measures should be laid down in a clear and timely manner in an exit strategy that should be reviewed by the auction monitor. EEX should develop such an exit strategy and take into utmost account the auction monitor’s opinion thereon. (8) An auction platform is required to obtain the auction monitor’s opinion on the methodology for the application of Articles 7(6) and 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010. However  where the auction monitor has not been appointed before the start of the auction concerned  the auction platform should be allowed to proceed without having obtained the auction monitor’s opinion. (9) Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly. (10) Moreover  certain references in Article 59(7) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 should be corrected. (11) In order to ensure predictable and timely auctions by the auction platform to be appointed by Germany  this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency.

PROCEDURE (1) On 10 September 1997  the Commission received a complaint concerning alleged injurious dumping by imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China. (2) The complaint was lodged by the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic)  on behalf of Degussa AG  the sole producer of thiourea dioxide in the Community. (3) The complaint contained evidence of dumping by the imports concerned and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding. (4) The Commission  after consultation  accordingly announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide currently classifiable within CN code ex 2930 90 70 originating in the People's Republic of China. (5) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned  the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producer. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING (6) By a letter of 6 April 1998 to the Commission  Cefic formally withdrew its complaint concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China citing changed circumstances as regards the Community industry having occurred after the lodging of the complaint. In particular  the complainant submitted that the situation of the sole Community producer had changed in the course of the investigation  mitigating the effect of the allegedly dumped imports. (7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the Council Regulation  (EC) No 384/96 when the complainant withdraws its complaint the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. The Commission considered that the present investigation has not brought to light any considerations of Community interest which would be against the termination of the proceeding. (8) Interested parties were informed of the Commission's intention to terminate the proceeding and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest. (9) Therefore the Commission has concluded that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China should be terminated without the imposition of measures ,1,0,0,0,0,0

For the sake of simplification it is necessary to convert that amount into head for live bovines and into tonnes for other products. (2) Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 lays down a period of validity of 75 days for export licences with advance fixing of the refund for pure-bred breeding animals falling within CN code 0102 10 and a period of four months plus the current month for licences issued under the procedure referred to in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88. Experience has shown that those periods are too brief and that they should be extended to five months plus the current month. At the same time  there should accordingly be a derogation increasing from 21 to 90 days the time limit referred to in Article 44(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 within which the exporter must inform the agency issuing the licence of the result of a tendering procedure opened in a third country.

31,Commission Regulation (EC) No 1184/2001 of 15 June 2001 fixing export refunds on nuts THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1)  as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 718/2001(2)  and in particular Article 35(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2190/96(3)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 298/2000(4)  lays down detailed rules on export refunds on fruit and vegetables. (2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that  to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported  the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds. (3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand  and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned. (4) Pursuant to Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. (5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph. (6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination. (7) Shelled almonds  hazelnuts and walnuts in shell can currently be exported in economically significant quantities. (8) Compared with other fruit and vegetables  nuts are relatively easy to store. Export refunds can accordingly be fixed for longer periods with a view to rational management of the arrangements. (9) The application of the abovementioned rules to the present and forecast market situation  and in particular to fruit and vegetable prices in the Community and international trade  gives the refund rates set out in the Annex hereto. (10) Pursuant to Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96  the resources available should be used as efficiently as possible while avoiding discrimination between traders. Therefore  care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables  quotas should be fixed for each product. (11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5)  as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2849/2000(6)  establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds. (12) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(7) lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products. (13) Owing to the market situation  in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports  the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A 1 and A 2 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2190/96 should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question. (14) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund  taking account in particular of their perishability. (15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables ,0,1,0,0,0,0
