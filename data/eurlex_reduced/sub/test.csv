1799,23.2.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 52/34 COMMISSION DECISION of 13 February 2006 requiring Member States temporarily to take additional measures against the dissemination of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode) as regards areas in Portugal  other than those in which it is known not to occur (notified under document number C(2006) 345) (2006/133/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES   Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community  Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1)  and in particular Article 16(3) thereof  Whereas: (1) Where a Member State considers that there is an imminent danger of the introduction into its territory of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode (PWN))  from another Member State  it should be authorised to temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger. (2) Portugal informed the other Member States and the Commission on 25 June 1999 that some samples of pine trees originating in its territory were identified as infested by PWN. The Commission has adopted Decisions 2000/58/EC (2) and 2001/218/EC (3) defining measures to be taken against PWN. (3) On the basis of assessments by the Food and Veterinary Office  most recently in November 2004  additional information submitted by Portugal and official surveys carried out by the other Member States on wood  isolated bark and plants of Abies Mill.  Cedrus Trew  Larix Mill.  Picea A. Dietr.  Pinus L.  Pseudotsuga Carr. and Tsuga Carr.  it appears that as a result of the application of an eradication programme in Portugal  the spread of PWN remains limited to the demarcated areas in Portugal. However  trees showing symptoms of infestation by PWN were still found during surveys of those areas. (4) The implementation of the Portuguese mid-term eradication plan for PWN of February 2003  as amended in June 2003  was evaluated by the Standing Committee on Plant Health in its meetings of July 2004 and May 2005. During the latter meeting it was concluded that the aimed reduction of infection level in the demarcated zone had not been fully achieved so far. (5) It is therefore necessary for Portugal to continue to take specific measures with respect to movements of wood  isolated bark and host plants within demarcated areas in Portugal and from such areas into other areas of Portugal and into the other Member States. (6) It is also necessary that Portugal continues to take measures to control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradication. Therefore  an updated mid-term eradication plan to better control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradicating should be presented. (7) The other Member States should continue to have the possibility to apply additional measures to protect their territories from PWN. (8) The results of the specific measures and of the implementation of the mid-term plan should be assessed continuously  in particular on the basis of information to be provided by Portugal and the other Member States.

1823,11.12.2013 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 332/5 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1281/2013 of 10 December 2013 laying down rules for the management and distribution of textile quotas established for the year 2014 under Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements  protocols or other arrangements  or by other specific Community import rules (1)  and in particular Article 17(3) and (6) and Article 21(2) thereof  Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 established quantitative restrictions on imports of certain textile products originating in certain third countries to be allocated on a first come  first served basis. (2) Under that Regulation it is possible  in certain circumstances  to use other allocation methods  to divide quotas into tranches  or to reserve a proportion of a specific quantitative limit exclusively for applications which are supported by evidence of the results of past import performance. (3) Rules for management of the quotas established for 2014 should be adopted before the quota year begins so that the continuity of trade flows is not affected unduly. (4) The measures adopted in previous years  such as those in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1163/2012 (2)  proved to be satisfactory and it is therefore appropriate to adopt similar rules for 2014. (5) In order to satisfy the greatest possible number of operators it is appropriate to make the ‘first come  first served’ allocation method more flexible by placing a ceiling on the quantities which can be allocated to each operator by that method. (6) To guarantee a degree of continuity in trade and efficient quota administration  operators should be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2014 equivalent to the quantity which they imported in 2013. (7) To achieve optimum use of the quantities  an operator who has used up at least one half of the amount already authorised should be permitted to apply for a further amount  provided that quantities are available in the quotas. (8) To secure a sound administration  import authorisations should be valid for nine months from the date of issue but only until the end of the year at the latest. Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and can certify  in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary  that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should  however  be authorised  in response to importers’ applications  to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2015 licences of which at least one half has been used by the application date. (9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textile Committee established by Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
